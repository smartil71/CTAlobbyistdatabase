### Using the Terminal for SQL Commands
You can run SQL commands in the terminal. To do so, you can either:
- Open up the Terminal, which can be found under the Tools tab or by pressing Shift+Alt+T. Type the command **sqlite3**.
- Click the **Launch SQLite** button in the menu at the top of the page.

Then, type the commands you want to run within SQLite!

### Creating a .sql file
You may also enter your SQL commands in a file and run them that way. Make sure your file ends in **.sql**, then run **sqlite3 < your_file.sql**. This uses input redirection to feed the SQL commands from your file into SQLite.

### Running Python
To run your Python file, you can either:
- Open up the terminal and type the command **python3 main.py**.
- Click the **Run Python file** button in the menu at the top of the page.

### Viewing Plots
Plots will not show up in the terminal. To be able to see them, click the **Virtual Desktop** button in the menu at the top of the page. It will open up a new tab that connects to a GUI server. Any plots you create will appear there.
